Подготовить деловое письмо-ответ на вопрос клиента:

Hello, team!

We got an email from google play about violations of their rules. They told us that we place interstitial ads so that they suddenly appear when a user is focused on a task at hand (e.g. playing a game, filling out a form, reading content) may lead to accidental clicks and often creates a frustrating user experience(see on the screenshot below).
Could you please describe how we can fix it? 

Kind regards.

### Мой ответ 

Dear [Client's Name],

We have received your message regarding the Google Play policy violation related to the placement of interstitial ads within your app. To fix this situation we would like to offer the following two solutions:

1.  Replace the interstitial ad with other ad types. For example banner (more information here (https://docs.appodeal.com/android/ad-types/banner)) or MREC (more information here (https://docs.appodeal.com/android/ad-types/mrec)). These ad types will minimize unintentional clicks and user frustration while still allowing the ad to be displayed on the Home screen.

2. Move the  interstitial ad to another screen within the app, preferably at a location that is less likely to disrupt the user's experience and will successfully address the concerns raised by Google Play.

We value your business and strive to provide the best service possible. Please don't hesitate to reach out to us if you have any further questions or need assistance.

Best regards,

Artsiom Karenka
